# AssignRef-Code

**AssignRef** is a modern one-step website with everything you need in sport league management
software including registration, game scheduling, communications, training and more.

While working on AssignRef, I was able to touch the front-end using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also worked to connect it to an external API called Stripe, which is a Payment Processing platform. In addition to that, I created tables and stored procedures in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 to store and retrieve information from the DB.

These are code snippets from AssignRef that I directly worked on. The files are separated into React, dotNet, and SQL.

_Note that SecuredRoutes has been stripped down of most of the code to show the paths that I worked on, as an example of the structure that we were using._
